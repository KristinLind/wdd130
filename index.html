        <p> Hello! My name is Kristin Lind and I am from South Jordan, Utah. I have been married for 36 years and have
            two daughters.
            I spent my career in dentistry and now I am venturing into the world of Software Development. I love to
            travel and have a
            travel agency that I run on the side. I have been fortunate to travel to over 50 countries. I love exploring
            nature, creating art,
            scuba diving, cooking and spending time with my family. I love to hike. One of my favorite places to hike
            and travel
            was Machu Picchu in Peru. We have such a beautiful world.
        </p>
